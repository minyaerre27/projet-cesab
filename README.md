# Alcohol Consumption Estimator

## Overview
This project aims to build a web application that helps individuals estimate their **annual alcohol consumption** based on their **weekly intake**.  
The application also compares the user’s estimated consumption with the **national average** of the country they reside in.

---

## Features
- **Annual Estimation**: Enter your weekly alcohol consumption and get an automatic calculation of your yearly intake (liters per year).
- **Country Comparison**: See how your consumption compares to the average in your country.
- **Data Visualization**: Clear charts and summaries to make the results easy to understand.
- **Privacy First**: No personal data is stored; calculations are performed only for the user session.

---

## Motivation
Alcohol consumption is often measured at the population level, but individuals rarely have a clear picture of their own habits in relation to national averages.

This tool provides:
- A simple way to **quantify personal consumption**.
- Contextual information to **compare with national statistics**.
- A foundation for **educational and awareness initiatives**.

## How It Works
1. **Input Weekly Consumption**  
   - Users enter their weekly alcohol intake (in equivalent units).
2. **Annual Calculation**  
   - The app multiplies weekly consumption by 52 to estimate yearly intake.
3. **Country Average Comparison**  
   - The app retrieves average consumption data for the user’s country.
   - A comparison is displayed to show whether the user is above, below, or near the national average.
