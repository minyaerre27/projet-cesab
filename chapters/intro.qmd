**Interested by the project ?**

*RCompendium was used to realise this project.*

It is available on [Github](https://github.com/minyaerre27/projet-cesab).

1.  [We asked people how many glasses they drank last week by categories.]{.blue}

-   **Beer** (25 cl) 🍺
-   **Wine** (10 cl) 🍷
-   **Apetizer** (7 cl) 🍹
-   **Liquor** (2.5 cl) 🥛

2.  [From those data we estimated the year consumption in consumption_year():]{.blue}

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
consumption_year <- function(data) {
    alcool_wine <- data$wine * 0.12 * 0.1 # wine conversion
    alcool_beer <- data$beers * 0.05 * 0.25 # beer conversion
    alcool_liquor <- data$liquor * 0.4 * 0.025 # liquor conversion
    alcool_apetizer <- data$apetizer * 0.18 * 0.07 # apetizer conversion
    cons_week <- alcool_wine + alcool_beer + alcool_liquor + alcool_apetizer # estimated consommation per week
    cons_year <- cons_week * 52 # estimated consommation per year
    data |> dplyr::mutate(cons_year)
}
```

3.  [When giving your weekly consommation, we will estimate which country best suit you !]{.blue} It will be your alcoholic country (see @fig-countries) !

Alcohol consumption per countries

# Example on the authors

For example, we did this experiment on the 5 of us:

__This is our data:__

```{r}
#| label: tbl-ourdata
#| tbl-cap: "Alcohol consumption of the authors"
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
knitr::kable(readr::read_csv("../data/smallData.csv"))

```

__And this is our results:__

1. [The following map shows which country in our alcoholic nationality:]{.blue}


2. [We wondered how much we diverged from our resident country (we are all from France oui oui baguette):]{.blue}
